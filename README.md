# activity-stream-okrs
These are quarterly team level OKR projects for the Activity Stream team

## 12 Month Vision
This quarter, Activity Stream is landing in Firefox and will be the default experience for about:newtab and about:home.

Activity Stream is more than just a way of finding places on the web youâ€™ve already visited.  It is an extensible platform for intelligently aggregating user activity and for making recommendations on new content.   Over the next twelve months, Activity Stream will integrate external data sources such as Context Graph and Pocket. 

This year we will also kick off the Signals initiative which will allow us to harvest richer data about how users browse the web, and use this to make new and/or better Activity Stream suggestions.
